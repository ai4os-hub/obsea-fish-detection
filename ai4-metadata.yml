title: OBSEA Fish Detection
summary: AI-based fish detection and classification algorithm based on YOLOv8.
description: |-
The OBSEA is an underwater observatory that has been acquiring multiparametric data
since 2009. Over the years, various cameras have been deployed, resulting in a vast 
archive of pictures dating back to 2011. Historically, this data has been manually 
analyzed to extract ecological information about the fish community in the area, a 
process that is both time-consuming and repetitive.

In this application, we employed an AI-based fish detection and classification algorithm, 
leveraging YOLOv8, to automate this process. The  model has been finetuned to 
detect and classify fish at the OBSEA underwater observatory. 

To enhance the model's performance, YOLOv8's (nano, xlarge) built-in data augmentation techniques 
were utilized. The hyperparameters controlling the data augmentation were optimized 
according to the guidelines provided in the official documentation.
This module is mainly based on this already [existing module](https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-yolov8-torch)

Here is an example of the model's output:
